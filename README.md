~PROJECT PLANNING~
The first most important thing before planning a project is to have a project goal or idea.
Once you have a project idea, you can now begin the planning process to determine specific details. 
PROJECT IDEA EXAMPLE: To Do List Application

1. USER STORIES - Depicts small scenerios from the user's perspective, these stories should emphasize the user's goal and motivation rather than the application itself.
- User Stories are brief, simple and informal.
- They typically follow the content, As a [user/role] I want[goal] so that [reason/benefit].
FOR EXAMPLE: As an intern, I want to add, delete, and update my tasks for the day so that I can be on schedule and not miss anything.

2. USE CASE - Typically include a topic, an actor, and scenerio that describes how a goal is achieved.

3. PROJECT REQUIREMENTS - Functional and non-functional requirements
- Functional Requirements: Describe what the application should do or should not do, they usually begin with "the application must" or "the application shall".
- Non-functional Requirements: Describe how the application should achieve its tasks.
  
4. ARCHITECTURE
   POTENTIAL NOUNS - Tasks, Routine, Schedule
   POTENTIAL CLASSES - Task, To-Do List, GUI
